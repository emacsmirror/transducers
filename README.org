#+title: Transducers: Ergonomic, efficient data processing

#+begin_quote
I think Transducers are a fundamental primitive that decouples critical logic
from list/sequence processing, and if I had to do Clojure all over I would put
them at the bottom.

-- Rich Hickey
#+end_quote

Transducers are an ergonomic and extremely memory-efficient way to process a
data source. Here "data source" means simple collections like Lists or Vectors,
but also potentially large files or generators of infinite data.

Transducers...

- allow the chaining of operations like =map= and =filter= without allocating memory between each step.
- aren't tied to any specific data type; they need only be implemented once.
- vastly simplify "data transformation code".
- have nothing to do with "lazy evaluation".
- are a joy to use!

Example: /While skipping every second line of a file, sum the lengths of only
evenly-lengthed lines./

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce
  ;; How do we want to process each element?
  (t-comp (t-step 2) (t-map #'length) (t-filter #'cl-evenp))
  ;; How do we want to combine all the elements together?
  #'+
  ;; What's our original data source?
  (t-file-read "README.org"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 7044

Looking for Transducers in other Lisps? Check out the [[https://codeberg.org/fosskers/cl-transducers][Common Lisp]] and [[https://codeberg.org/fosskers/transducers.fnl][Fennel]]
implementations!

* History and Motivation

Originally invented in Clojure and later adapted to other Lisps, Transducers are
an excellent way to think about - and efficiently operate on - collections or
streams of data. Transduction operations are strict and don't involve "laziness"
or "thunking" in any way, yet only process the exact amount of data you ask them
to.

This library is mostly a port of the [[https://git.sr.ht/~fosskers/cl-transducers][Common Lisp implementation]], with a few
alterations to account for the minor differences between Common Lisp and Emacs
Lisp.

* Installation

This package is [[https://melpa.org/#/transducers][available on MELPA]].

* Usage

** Importing

Since this is just a library, you can import it as usual:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'transducers)
#+end_src

Every function in the library is prefixed by =transducers-= but you're encouraged
to use ~read-symbol-shorthands~ to shorten this to =t-=. This can be done
interactively in your own files via ~add-file-local-variable~, which you
can use to set this at the bottom of your file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Local Variables:
;; read-symbol-shorthands: (("t-" . "transducers-"))
;; End:
#+end_src

After this, you can make relatively clean calls like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce (t-map #'1+) #'t-vector '(1 2 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [2 3 4]

This can also be done in =.org= files, so that Transducers can be used in their
short forms even in Babel source blocks. That's exactly what this README does!

The remaining examples below use =t-= for brevity.

** Transducers, Reducers, and Sources

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; The fundamental pattern.
(t-transduce <transducer-chain> <reducer> <source>)
#+end_src

Data processing largely has three concerns:

1. Where is my data coming from? (sources)
2. What do I want to do to each element? (transducers)
3. How do I want to collect the results? (reducers)

Each full "transduction" requires all three. We pass one of each to the
=t-transduce= function, which drives the process. It knows how to pull values from
the source, feed them through the transducer chain, and wrap everything together
via the reducer.

- Typical transducers are =t-map=, =t-filter=, and =t-take=.
- Typical reducers are =+=, =t-count=, =t-cons=, and =t-fold=.
- Typical sources are lists, vectors, strings, hash tables, and files.

/Generators/ are a special kind of source that yield infinite data. Typical
generators are =t-repeat=, =t-cycle=, and =t-ints=.

Let's sum the squares of the first 1000 odd integers:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce
 (t-comp (t-filter #'cl-oddp)          ;; (2) Keep only odd numbers.
         (t-take 1000)                 ;; (3) Keep the first 1000 filtered odds.
         (t-map (lambda (n) (* n n)))) ;; (4) Square those 1000.
 #'+         ;; (5) Reducer: Add up all the squares.
 (t-ints 1)) ;; (1) Source: Generate all positive integers.
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1333333000

Two things of note here:

1. =t-comp= is used here to chain together different transducer steps. Notice that
   the order appears "backwards" from usual function composition. It may help to
   imagine that =t-comp= is acting like the =thread-last= macro here.
2. The reduction via =+= is listed as Step 5, but really it's occuring throughout
   the transduction process. Each value that makes it through the composed
   transducer chain is immediately added to an internal accumulator.

Explore the other transducers and reducers to see what's possible! You'll never
write a =loop= again.

* API

As mentioned above, the examples prefix all function calls with =t-= via
"shorthands".

** Transducers

Transducers describe how to alter the items of some stream of values. Some
transducers, like ~take~, can short-circuit.

Multiple transducer functions can be chained together with ~t-comp~.

*** t-pass, t-map

Just pass along each value of the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-cons '(1 2 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 2 3)

Apply a function F to all elements of the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-map #'1+) #'t-cons '(1 2 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (2 3 4)

*** t-filter, t-filter-map, t-unique, t-dedup

Only keep elements from the transduction that satisfy PRED.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-filter #'cl-evenp) #'t-cons '(1 2 3 4 5))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (2 4)

Apply a function F to the elements of the transduction, but only keep results
that are non-nil.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-filter-map #'cl-first) #'t-cons '(() (2 3) () (5 6) () (8 9)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (2 5 8)

Only allow values to pass through the transduction once each. Stateful; this
uses a set internally so could get quite heavy if you're not careful.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-unique #'t-cons '(1 2 1 3 2 1 2 "abc"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 2 3 "abc")

Remove adjacent duplicates from the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-dedup #'t-cons '(1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 3 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 2 3 4 3)

*** t-drop, t-drop-while, t-take, t-take-while

Drop the first N elements of the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-drop 3) #'t-cons '(1 2 3 4 5))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (4 5)

Drop elements from the front of the transduction that satisfy PRED.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-drop-while #'cl-evenp) #'t-cons '(2 4 6 7 8 9))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (7 8 9)

Keep only the first N elements of the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-take 3) #'t-cons '(1 2 3 4 5))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 2 3)

Keep only elements which satisfy a given PRED, and stop the transduction as soon
as any element fails the test.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-take-while #'cl-evenp) #'t-cons '(2 4 6 8 9 2))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (2 4 6 8)

*** t-uncons, t-concatenate, t-flatten

Split up a transduction of cons cells.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-uncons #'t-cons '((:a . 1) (:b . 2) (:c . 3)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (:a 1 :b 2 :c 3)

Concatenate all the sublists, subvectors, or substrings in the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-concatenate #'t-cons '((1 2 3) [4 5 6] (7 8 9)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-comp #'t-concatenate (t-intersperse ?!))
             #'t-string '("hello" "there"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "h!e!l!l!o!t!h!e!r!e"

Entirely flatten all lists/arrays/strings in the transduction, regardless of
nesting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-flatten #'t-cons '((1 2 3) 0 (4 (5) 6) 0 (7 [8] 9) 0))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 2 3 0 4 5 6 0 7 8 9 0)

*** t-segment, t-window, t-group-by

Partition the input into lists of N items. If the input stops, flush any
accumulated state, which may be shorter than N.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-segment 3) #'t-cons '(1 2 3 4 5))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ((1 2 3) (4 5))

Yield N-length windows of overlapping values. This is different from ~segment~
which yields non-overlapping windows. If there were fewer items in the input
than N, then this yields nothing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-window 3) #'t-cons '(1 2 3 4 5))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ((1 2 3) (2 3 4) (3 4 5))

Group the input stream into sublists via some function F. The cutoff criterion
is whether the return value of F changes between two consecutive elements of the
transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-group-by #'t-evenp) #'t-cons '(2 4 6 7 9 1 2 4 6 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ((2 4 6) (7 9 1) (2 4 6) (3))

*** t-intersperse, t-enumerate, t-step, t-scan

Insert an ELEM between each value of the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-intersperse 0) #'t-cons '(1 2 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 0 2 0 3)

Index every value passed through the transduction into a cons pair. Starts at 0.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'enumerate #'t-cons '("a" "b" "c"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ((0 . "a") (1 . "b") (2 . "c"))

Only yield every Nth element of the transduction. The first element of the
transduction is always included.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-step 2) #'t-cons '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 3 5 7 9)

Build up successsive values from the results of previous applications of a given
function F.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-scan #'+ 0) #'t-cons '(1 2 3 4))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (0 1 3 6 10)

*** t-once

Inject some ITEM onto the front of the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-comp (t-filter (lambda (n) (> n 10)))
                     (t-once 'hello)
                     (t-take 3))
           #'t-cons (t-ints 1))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (hello 11 12)

*** t-log

Call some LOGGER function for each step of the transduction. The LOGGER must
accept the running results and the current element as input. The original items
of the transduction are passed through as-is.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results output :exports both
(t-transduce (t-log (lambda (_ n) (print (format "Got: %s" n)))) #'t-cons '(1 2 3 4 5))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

"Got: 1"

"Got: 2"

"Got: 3"

"Got: 4"

"Got: 5"
#+end_example

These are STDOUT results. The actual return value is the result of the reducer,
in this case ~cons~, thus a list.

** Reducers

Reducers describe how to fold the stream of items down into a single result, be
it either a new collection or a scalar.

Some reducers, like ~t-first~, can also force the entire transduction to
short-circuit.

*** t-cons, t-snoc, t-vector, t-string, t-hash-table

Collect all results as a list.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-cons '(1 2 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 2 3)

Collect all results as a list, but results are reversed. In theory, slightly
more performant than ~t-cons~ since it performs no final reversal.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-snoc '(1 2 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (3 2 1)

Collect a stream of values into a vector.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-vector '(1 2 3))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1 2 3]

Collect a stream of characters into to a single string.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-map #'upcase) #'t-string "hello")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "HELLO"

Collect a stream of key-value cons pairs into a hash table.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-enumerate #'t-hash-table '("a" "b" "c"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #s(hash-table size 65 test equal rehash-size 1.5 rehash-threshold 0.8125 data (0 "a" 1 "b" 2 "c"))

*** t-count, t-average, t-median

Count the number of elements that made it through the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-count '(1 2 3 4 5))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 5

Calculate the average value of all numeric elements in a transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-average '(1 2 3 4 5 6))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3.5

Calculate the median value of all elements in a transduction, provided that they
are numbers, strings, or characters. The elements are sorted once before the
median is extracted.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-median '(1 1 1 0 2 4 1 4 9))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1

*** t-anyp, t-allp

Yield t if any element in the transduction satisfies PRED. Short-circuits the
transduction as soon as the condition is met.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass (t-anyp #'cl-evenp) '(1 3 5 7 9 2))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: t

Yield t if all elements of the transduction satisfy PRED. Short-circuits with
NIL if any element fails the test.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass (t-allp #'cl-oddp) '(1 3 5 7 9))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: t

*** t-first, t-last, t-find

Yield the first value of the transduction. As soon as this first value is
yielded, the entire transduction stops.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce (t-filter #'t-oddp) #'t-first '(2 4 6 7 10))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 7

Yield the last value of the transduction.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-last '(2 4 6 7 10))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 10

Find the first element in the transduction that satisfies a given PRED. Yields
NIL if no such element were found.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass (t-find #'cl-evenp) '(1 3 5 6 9))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 6

*** t-fold

~t-fold~ is the fundamental reducer. ~t-fold~ creates an ad-hoc reducer based on
a given 2-argument function. An optional SEED value can also be given as the
initial accumulator value, which also becomes the return value in case there
were no input left in the transduction.

Functions like ~+~ and ~*~ are automatically valid reducers, because they yield sane
values even when given 0 or 1 arguments. Other functions like ~max~ cannot be used
as-is as reducers since they can't be called without arguments. For functions
like this, ~t-fold~ is appropriate.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass (t-fold #'max) '(1 2 3 4 1000 5 6))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1000

With a seed:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass (t-fold #'max 0) '())
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0

In Clojure this function is called =completing=.

*** t-for-each

Run through every item in a transduction for their side effects. Throws away all
results and yields t.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-map (lambda (n) (message "%s" n))) #'t-for-each [1 2 3 4])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: t

** Sources

Data is pulled in an on-demand fashion from /Sources/. They can be either finite
or infinite in length. A list is an example of a simple Source, but you can also
pull from files and endless number generators.

*** t-ints, t-random

Yield all integers, beginning with START and advancing by an optional STEP value
which can be positive or negative. If you only want a specific range within the
transduction, then use ~t-take-while~ within your transducer chain.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-take 10) #'t-cons (t-ints 0 :step 2))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18)

Yield an endless stream of random numbers, based on a given LIMIT.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-take 20) #'t-cons (t-random 10))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (3 9 9 2 2 3 6 3 7 3 3 6 3 6 0 7 5 4 9 5)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-take 3) #'t-cons (t-random 1.0))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (0.47136199474334717 0.10177326202392578 0.2851991653442383)

*** t-cycle, t-repeat, t-shuffle

Yield the values of a given SEQ endlessly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-take 10) #'t-cons (t-cycle '(1 2 3)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1)

Endlessly yield a given ITEM.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-take 4) #'t-cons (t-repeat 9))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (9 9 9 9)

Endlessly yield random elements from a given vector.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-take 5) #'t-cons (t-shuffle ["Alice" "Bob" "Dennis"]))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ("Dennis" "Alice" "Alice" "Dennis" "Alice")

Recall also that strings are vectors too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-take 15) #'t-string (t-shuffle "Númenor"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "rúmnmonNroenmnN"

*** t-plist

Yield key-value pairs from a Property List, usually known as a 'plist'. The
pairs are passed as a cons cell.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce (t-map #'cdr) #'+ (t-plist '(:a 1 :b 2 :c 3)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 6

See also the ~t-uncons~ transducer for another way to handle incoming cons cells.

*** t-reversed

Yield a vector's elements in reverse order.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both :results verbatim
(t-transduce (t-take 2) #'t-cons (t-reversed [1 2 3 4]))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (4 3)

Recall that strings are also vectors.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both :results verbatim
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-string (t-reversed "Hello"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "olleH"

** Utilities

*** t-comp, t-const

Function composition. You can pass as many functions as you like and they are
applied from right to left.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(funcall (t-comp #'length #'reverse) [1 2 3])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3

For transducer functions specifically, they are /composed/ from right to left, but
their effects are /applied/ from left to right. This is due to how the reducer
function is chained through them all internally via ~t-transduce~.

Notice here how ~t-drop~ is clearly applied first:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim :exports both
(t-transduce (t-comp (t-drop 3) (t-take 2)) #'t-cons '(1 2 3 4 5 6))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (4 5)

Return a function that ignores its argument and returns ITEM instead.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(funcall (t-comp (t-const 108) (lambda (n) (* 2 n)) #'1+) 1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 108

*** t-reduced, t-reduced-p, t-reduced-val

When writing your own transducers and reducers, these functions allow you to
short-circuit the entire operation.

Here is a simplified definition of ~t-first~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
(defun t-first (&rest vargs)
  (pcase vargs
    (`(,_ ,input) (t-reduced input))
    (`(,acc) acc)
    (_ nil)))
#+end_src

You can see ~t-reduced~ being used to wrap the return value. ~t-transduce~ sees this
wrapping and immediately halts further processing.

~t-reduced-p~ and ~t-reduced-val~ can similarly be used (mostly within transducer
functions) to check if some lower transducer (or the reducer) has signaled a
short-circuit, and if so potentially perform some clean-up. This is important
for transducers that carry internal state.

* Example Gallery

** Words in a File

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce (t-comp (t-map #'split-string)
                     #'t-concatenate)
             #'t-count
             (t-file-read "README.org"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1101

** Splitting a string by its lines

Transducing over a string yields its characters:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-count "hello\nworld!")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 12

If you want to transduce over its lines instead, create a temporary buffer
first:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both :results verbatim
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert "hello\nworld!")
  (t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-cons (current-buffer)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ("hello" "world!")

** Reading and Writing CSV data

This library also provides two transducers for processing CSV data: =t-from-csv=
and =t-into-csv=. The original data can come from any source, like a file, open
buffer, or raw string.

=t-from-csv= reads the data into a stream of Hash Tables with each value keyed to
the fields provided in the first line. =t-into-csv= reverses the process, given a
sequence of headers to select.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both :results verbatim
(t-transduce (t-comp #'t-from-csv
                     (t-into-csv ["Age" "Name"]))
             #'t-cons
             ["Name,Age,Hair" "Alice,35,Blond" "Bob,26,Black"])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ("Age,Name" "35,Alice" "26,Bob")

Here we're immediately converting back into CSV strings, but with =t-comp= we're
free to add as many intermediate steps as we like.

** Reading and Writing JSON data

It is also possible to read from and write to JSON buffers. Reading assumes that
the buffer contains a top-level array. By default, yielded objects are plists,
but this can be customized via the ~:object-type~ keyword.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both :results verbatim
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert "[{\"name\": \"Colin\"},{\"name\": \"Jack\"}]")
  (t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-cons (t-from-json-buffer (current-buffer))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ((:name "Colin") (:name "Jack"))

Note that ~t-from-json-buffer~ is a "source".

Likewise, ~t-into-json-buffer~ is a reducer that writes a stream of lisp values
back into the current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(with-temp-buffer
  (t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-into-json-buffer '((:name "Colin") (:name "Jack")))
  (buffer-string))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [{"name":"Colin"},{"name":"Jack"}]

Note that ~t-into-json-buffer~ makes no assumptions about where point initially is
the current buffer, nor is the buffer automatically saved. Such concerns are the
responsibility of the user.

** Reducing into Property Lists and Assocation Lists

There is no special reducer function for plists, because none is needed. If you
have a stream of cons cells, you can break it up with ~t-uncons~ and then collect
with ~t-cons~ as usual:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both :results verbatim
(t-transduce (t-comp (t-map (lambda (pair) (cons (car pair) (1+ (cdr pair)))))
                     #'t-uncons)
             #'t-cons
             (t-plist '(:a 1 :b 2 :c 3)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (:a 2 :b 3 :c 4)

Likewise, Association Lists are already lists-of-cons-cells, so no special
treatment is needed:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both
(t-transduce #'t-pass #'t-cons '((:a . 1) (:b . 2) (:c . 3)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ((:a . 1) (:b . 2) (:c . 3))
